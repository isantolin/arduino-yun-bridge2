# DEPRECATED: this file is no longer installed by the OpenWrt package.
# YunBridge v2 reads its serial configuration from /etc/config/yunbridge
# under the section 'general' (e.g. yunbridge.general.serial_port).
#
# The package now seeds a safe default via:
#   /etc/uci-defaults/98-yunbridge-default-serial
#
# This file is kept only for historical reference.
