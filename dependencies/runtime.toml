# Single source of truth for YunBridge daemon dependencies.
#
# Each entry is consumed by tooling that renders pip requirements and
# OpenWrt package dependency lists. Fields:
#   name      - Human readable identifier used for documentation.
#   openwrt   - Package name as published in the OpenWrt feeds (without '+').
#   pip       - Optional PEP 508 requirement string for pip/venv workflows.
#   rationale - Short note explaining why the dependency is needed.
